# Sparta_Sort_Manager

In this programme, the user initially inputs an array length in the form of an integer, the programme will then 
generate an unsorted array of random values from 1 to the length specified by the user. The user then specifies
the sorting algorithm they would like to use (from a list of options) to sort the array. The programme then uses
the chosen algorithm to sort the array and displays it to the user along with the time taken to perform the sort.

Developers will find the testbed for this project in the 'test' folder under 'src'. If the developer should
with to create additional sorting algorithms they must implement the 'Sortable' interface in the 'sorters' package
under 'com.sparta.jw'.
